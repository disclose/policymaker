## Security.txt


Security.txt provides a machine-readable file which defines core attributes or your VDP, and is designed to be hosted on websites. 

The security.txt file should be placed under the `/.well-known/` path (`/.well-known/security.txt`) on websites. It can also be placed in the root directory (`/security.txt`) of a website, especially if the `/.well-known/` directory cannot be used for technical reasons or as a fallback. The file can be placed in both locations of a website at the same time.
