# Simple Safe Harbor

We will consider your security research to be authorized if you make a good faith effort to comply with this policy during your security research. If your activities violate certain restrictions in our Acceptable Use Policy, we will waive those restrictions for the limited purpose of allowing security research. We will not sue you for attempting to circumvent the technological safeguards we have put in place to protect the applications in scope. If a third party takes legal action against you for activities carried out in accordance with this policy, we will make this authorization known.

For inadvertent, good-faith violations of this policy, we will not take civil action or file a report with law enforcement. Before doing anything that may be inconsistent with or unaddressed by this policy, please contact us by submitting a report.
